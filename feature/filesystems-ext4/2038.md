# Bug 2038 

## Too small inode size (128) cause 2038 - bug 

```
# Diagnostics:
tune2fs -l /dev/<device> | grep "Inode size"
```

## Remarks 

```
ext4 filesystem now supports timestamps beyond the year 2038

The ext4 filesystem is now supporting timestamps beyond the year 2038.
This feature is fully automatic and does not require any user action to
leverage it. The only requirement is that the inode size is larger than 128 bytes,
which it is by default.
